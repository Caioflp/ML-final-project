# Income Prediction on US citizens

This is the final project on the Bachelor's Machine Learning course at
EMAp-FGV. The data used was obtained [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
The objective is to predict if a given individual makes more or less than
50K USD per year.

## Possible classification algorithms

* Logistic regression
    - Regularization
    - Optimization algorithm
    - Scale data
* K Nearest Neighbours
* Classification Trees
* SVM

## Other ideas

* Recreate missing data using something like an EM algorithm or MCMC
* Explore some unsupervised learning algorithms to find clusters in data
* Use some of the sklearn functions to perform feature reduction

## TODO

* Implement validation
